## [Telegram](https://telegram.org)
Telegram is a free and open source, cross-platform, cloud-based instant messaging software.
This service also provides end-to-end encrypted video calling, VoIP, file sharing and several other features.
It was launched for iOS on 14 August 2013 and Android in October 2013.
The servers of Telegram are distributed worldwide to decrease data load with five data centers in different regions, 
while the operational center is based in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.
Various client apps are available for desktop and mobile platforms including official apps for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS and Linux. 
There are also two official Telegram web twin apps – WebK and WebZ – and numerous unofficial clients that make use of Telegram's protocol. 
All of Telegram's official components are open source, with the exception of the server which is closed-sourced and proprietary. 
Telegram provides end-to-end encrypted voice and video calls and optional end-to-end encrypted "secret" chats.

## [Telegram Bots](https://core.telegram.org/bots)

Bots are simply Telegram accounts operated by software – not people – and they'll often have AI features. They can do anything – teach, play, search, broadcast, remind, connect, integrate with other services, or even pass commands to the Internet of Things.
